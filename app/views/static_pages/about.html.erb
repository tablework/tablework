        Red Five standing by. He is here. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. 
        I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.

        Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. 
        I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? 
        Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. 
        Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!

        Hey, Luke! I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- 
        I have traced the Rebel spies to her. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.
